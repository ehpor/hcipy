class Detector(object):

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector_grid : Grid
        The grid on which the detector returns its images. These indicate
        the centers of the pixels.
    subsampling : integer or scalar or ndarray
        The number of subpixels per pixel along one axis. For example, a
        value of 2 indicates that 2x2=4 subpixels are used per pixel. If
        this is a scalar, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. If
        this is an array, the subsampling factor will be different for
        each dimension. Default: 1.

class NoisyDetector(Detector):
    '''A detector class that has some basic noise properties.

    A detector that includes the following noise sources: photon shot noise, dark current
    shot noise, flat field errors and read noise. These noise sources (except for photon shot
    noise) can be either a scalar (same for entire grid) or an array. For the flat field error
    specifically: if a scalar is given, a normal distributed flat field map (given scalar
    is standard deviation about 1) is generated that will be used - if an array is given, that
    array will be used, so it will NOT be a normal distributed flat field where every point in
    array gives the standard deviation. This allows the user to load a specific flat field map.

    The detector can also integrate supersampled wavefronts and subsample them to the correct
    grid size. This allows for the averaging of the power over one detector pixel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector_grid : Grid
        The grid on which the detector samples.
    dark_current_rate : scalar or array_like
        An array or scalar that gives dark current rate in counts per unit time for each point
        in the grid.
    read_noise : scalar or array_like
        An array or scalar that gives the rms read noise counts for each point in the grid.
    flat_field : scalar or array_like
        An array or scalar that gives the flat field error for each point in the
        grid. If a scalar is given, a random normal distributed flat field map (given scalar
        is standard deviation about 1) is generated that will be used.
    include_photon_noise : boolean
        Turns the photon noise on or off. Default: True.
    subsampling : integer or scalar or ndarray
        The number of subpixels per pixel along one axis. For example, a
        value of 2 indicates that 2x2=4 subpixels are used per pixel. If
        this is a scalar, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. If
