    Parameters
    ----------

        The pupil grid for which the focal grid needs to be calculated. The extent of this Grid

    This grid will be a CartesianGrid with RegularCoords, and supports different resolutions, samplings,
    or extent in x and y. If `spatial_resolution` is 1, then the grid will be returned in normalized
    (ie. homogenized) coordinates. Otherwise, it will be in physical units. The spatial resolution is
    defined by:

    .. math:: \Delta x = \lambda f / D = \lambda F

    where :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength, :math:`f` is the effective focal length before the focal plane,
    :math:`D` is the diameter of the pupil, and :math:`F` is the F-number of the incoming light beam.
    You can supply either the spatial resolution or a set of focal length, reference wavelength and pupil diameter,
    or a set of F-number and reference wavelength. If none are supplied, a spatial resolution of 1 will be
    assumed, meaning normalized units.

    The grid will always contain the origin (0, 0) point.

    q : scalar or tuple of floats

    num_airy : scalar or tuple of floats

    spatial_resolution : scalar or tuple of floats
        The physical size of a resolution element (= lambda f / D). It this is not given,
        the spatial resolution will be calculated from the given `focal_length`,
        `reference_wavelength` and `pupil_diameter`.
    pupil_diameter : scalar or tuple of floats
        The diameter of the pupil. If it is an array, this indicates the diameter in x and y.
    focal_length : scalar
        The focal length used for calculating the spatial resolution at the focal plane.
    f_number : scalar or tuple of floats
        The F number, also known as focal ratio, at the focal plane. If this is given, it overrides
