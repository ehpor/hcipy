# This file contains all git hashes with far-reaching commits into the codebase.
# We often want to remove these commits from git blame. The commit hashes in
# this file are already removed from the git-blame on Github. You can do the
# same locally with:
#
#     > git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# or set it permanently with:
#
#     > git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
