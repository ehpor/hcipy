    Parameters
    ----------
    field : Field or ndarray
        The field to interpolate.
    grid : Grid or None
        The grid of the field. If it is given, the grid of `field` is replaced by this grid.

    Returns
    -------
    Field generator
        The interpolator, as a Field generator. The grid on which this field generator will evaluated, does
        not have to be separated.

    Parameters
    ----------
