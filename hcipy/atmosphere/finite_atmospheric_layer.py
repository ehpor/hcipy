class FiniteAtmosphericLayer(AtmosphericLayer):
    '''An atmospheric layer simulating atmospheric turbulence.

    This atmospheric layer is finite. This means that it will wrap
    after translation by more than `oversampling` times the extent of
    the input grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_grid : Grid
        The grid on which the incoming wavefront is defined.
    Cn_squared : scalar
        The integrated strength of the turbulence for this layer.
    L0 : scalar
        The outer scale for the atmospheric turbulence of this layer.
        The default is infinity.
    velocity : scalar or array_like
        The wind speed for this atmospheric layer. If this is a scalar,
        the wind will be along x. If this is a 2D array, then the values
        are interpreted as the wind speed along x and y. The default is
        zero.
    height : scalar
        The height of the atmospheric layer. By itself, this value has no
        influence, but it'll be used by the AtmosphericModel to perform
        inter-layer propagations.
    oversampling : scalar
        The amount of oversampling in the Fourier space. The atmospheric layer
        will wrap after translation by more than `oversampling` times the extent of
        the input grid. The default is 2.
    seed : None, int, array of ints, SeedSequence, BitGenerator, Generator
        A seed to initialize the spectral noise. If None, then fresh, unpredictable
        entry will be pulled from the OS. If an int or array of ints, then it will
        be passed to a numpy.SeedSequency to derive the initial BitGenerator state.
        If a BitGenerator or Generator are passed, these will be wrapped and used
        instead. Default: None.

        Parameters
        ----------
        make_independent_realization : boolean
            Whether to start an independent realization of the noise for the
            atmospheric layer or not. When this is False, the exact same phase
            screens will be generated as in the first run, as long as the Cn^2
            and outer scale are the same. This allows for testing of multiple
            runs of a control system with different control parameters. When
            this is True, an independent realization of the atmospheric layer
            will be generated. This is useful for Monte-Carlo-style computations.
            The default is False.
